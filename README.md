# ArchLinuxDatePicker
This software allows the user to have a graphical interface to change the date and time of the computer. This application is especially useful for those users who have to constantly change the date and time of thier computers due to the bios battery running out and the time and date resetting as a result.

*Note: This application is designed to run only with arch based linux distributions as of now.

**SETUP AND RUN**
- Navigate to the file 'setup.sh', open it with a text editor and replace 'alacritty' with the terminal you use. (If you use alacritty please ignore this step)
- Run the script and provide your sudo password to start downloading the required packages.
- After the setup is complete, navigate to the script 'run.sh' and execute it. (You need to edit the file if you are not using alacritty terminal as done in step 1)
- You should have the application up and running. Enjoy!
